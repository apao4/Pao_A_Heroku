# Allison Pao Heroku Product App

This is an product application based on the popular water bottles, Swell.  Swell was designed for functionality and minimalism which this app intends to portray.  With a very simple design, users can browse the three most popular styles of bottles - the classic, traveler, and roamer.  With a minimalistic design, the bottles speak for themselves as they stand out and sell their own name.
